# Please-help-me-program-my-invention
I want to make a non-profit invention for old people and to look good for colleges. Please could you help me write the code for it.
It is a remote for old people that dials numbers and controls the tv. It would house a microphone, speaker, and a microcontroller with bluetooth capability to call the programmed numbers, 911, control the volume and hang up. The infrared sensor would be calibrated for the individual's TV(the grandparent's kids would set this up)then being able to change channel, volume, and turn it on or off.
